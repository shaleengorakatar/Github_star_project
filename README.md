# Best Variables for Prediction for GitHub Stars
### By Shaleen Gorakatar

## Introduction
GitHub repositories are online platforms that are useful for coding projects and assignments. Repositories allow for collaboration with other GitHub users, as well as viewing opportunities for anyone interested in exploring topics of interest. Projects can vary based on content, coding language and size, just to name a few aspects. Furthermore, repository features allow for identifying popularity among repositories, something which will be of importance in our analysis. GitHub is a website that provides a graphical interface for version control using Git which allows developers to maintain their code and track the versions of their project as it progresses. Projects are hosted in repositories, which can be starred by GitHub users if they like them. Surveys confirm that stars are viewed by pratictioners as the most useful measure of a repository's popularity (Borges & Valente, 2018). As GitHub becomes more and more prevalent among developers for use in version control, it can be interesting to see what variables best predict popularity. Recent attempts have been made to solve this problem, such as Moid et. al. with a Random Forest regressor, but no research exists on using LASSO feature selection with multiple linear regression on this problem (2021). 

My question will be the following:

*Which explanatory variables best predict stars on a GitHub repository?*
